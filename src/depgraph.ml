(** A submachine represents some part (subset of state space) of one
    or more bigger NFAs. Each such "bigger" NFA is referenced by node
    id, a list of potential start states, and a list of potential
    final states. Separate from that mapping we also store an NFA;
    this matches the language of the node prior to it getting

(** A supermachine represents at least two concatenated submachines,

    - node id of this submachine
    - set of 'final' transitions for this submachine

    Adjacent transition sets overlap; for example, for a sequence
    [a;b], the final transition set for a is the start transition set
    for b. We use a shared list representation so that changes to the
    transition sets directly affect all relevant submachines.

(** Nodes represent variables and constants; edges represent direct
    dependencies between the nodes. [inedge] Represents the possible
    kinds of inbound edges; [outedge] encodes the corresponding 
    kinds of outbound edges. 

    Note that, for concatenation, we encode the order in the type
    constructors. For example, if node [s1] has an [OutConcatLeft(s2,
    b)] edge, then we have [b alias s1 . s2] and node [s2] will have
    a corresponding edge [OutConcatRight(s1, b)].
